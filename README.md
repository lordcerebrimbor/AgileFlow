Project Vision

AgileFlow was developed to prove that enterprise-grade project management tools can be both lightweight and powerful. By combining local-first privacy with AI-driven intelligence, it empowers developers to focus on the build, not the management of the build.

Developed with a focus on AI applications and engineering productivity.
